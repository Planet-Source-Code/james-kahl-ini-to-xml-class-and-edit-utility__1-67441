### Description

I have seen several INI to XML conversion submissions on PSC, but they all seemed to lack some functionality, so I decided to write this. With this class you can convert INI files to compatible XML files and a create a new file. You can also create, delete and edit sections and keys as you wish. I think the editor is pretty easy to use, but have included a Word document that describes how to perform certain tasks. Please let me know what you think, bugs found, or any ideas for improvement.
